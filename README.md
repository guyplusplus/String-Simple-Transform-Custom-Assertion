# String Simple Transform Custom Assertion

This assertion allows simple transformation such as:
* trim spaces
* to upper case and lower case
* encore and decode hexadecimal strings in UTF-8 and UTF-16 character sets
* encode and decode JSON and XML 1.0 and 1.1 strings

It has been designed to support easy addition of a new type transformation without the need of the Custom Assertion SDK. The 'transforms' package is independent and can be compiled without the SDK.
